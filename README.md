# minions

## Getting Started

### Instructions
Scroll down to the "Local Setup" part of the README, and do the stuff it says there

### Project Organization
The code consists of two projects: server and client, each one with its own source directory, structured in the usual way for an sbt project.
Additionally, there is a source folder called 'core' that is shared between the two.

The main class and entry point for server is server/src/main/scala/ServerMain.scala
The main class and entry point for client is server/src/main/scala/ClientMain.scala

Server is compiled the usual way, to run on the JVM.
Client is compiled via ScalaJS into javascript.

See build.sbt for all the nitty-gritty details of the configuration.

## Troubleshooting

### SBT memory issues

Note that to avoid memory leaks via Java's permanent generation in a long-running sbt process,
you may need to edit your sbt configuration (i.e. the sbt script installed at ~/bin/sbt) if
you have Java 1.7 or earlier. If you do encounter out-of-memory issues in sbt, try editing the script
to call Java with the following flags:

    -XX:+CMSClassUnloadingEnabled
    -XX:+UseConcMarkSweepGC
    -XX:MaxPermSize=1G

### Scala SBT file name length errors

If during a compile in SBT you encounter the error `filename too long` or similar, it may be due to sbt trying to generate a file whose name exceeds the max allowed filename length on your system. See if you can specify an override for your sbt install to cap the filename length it uses:

## Local Setup
1. Clone the repo
  * git clone https://github.com/jonathanpaulson/minions.git
2. Install Java/Scala/sbt. We'll use https://sdkman.io/
  * $ curl -s "https://get.sdkman.io" | bash
  * $ sdk install java 8.0.242.j9-adpt
  * $ sdk install scala 2.13.1
  * $ sdk install sbt 1.3.9
3. Compile + Run
  * $ cd minions (go to directory where you cloned the repo)
  * $ sbt
  * $ buildEverything (in sbt console)
  * $ minionsJVM/run
4. Visit localhost:8080. Your local copy should be running there.

## AWS Setup
1. Reserve a medium instance (in AWS console)
2. Allocate an elastic IP (default settings; in AWS console)
3. Associate the elastic IP with the instance (in AWS console)

4. Setup SSH forwarding
  * $ eval `ssh-agent -s`
  * $ ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa (on your box)
  * Edit ~/.ssh/config (on your box) to contain:
```
Host ec2-54-152-88-227.compute-1.amazonaws.com
  ForwardAgent yes
```

5. SSH to the instance
6. sudo yum install git -y (on instance)
7. git clone git@github.com:jonathanpaulson/minions.git (on instance)

8. Install Java 8 (locally on instance)
  1. wget --no-check-certificate --no-cookies --header "Cookie: oraclelicense=accept-securebackup-cookie" http://download.oracle.com/otn-pub/java/jdk/8u141-b15/336fa29ff2bb4ef291e347e091f7f4a7/jdk-8u141-linux-x64.rpm
  * sudo yum install -y jdk-8u141-linux-x64.rpm

9. Install SBT (locally on instance).
  * curl https://bintray.com/sbt/rpm/rpm | sudo tee /etc/yum.repos.d/bintray-sbt-rpm.repo
  * sudo yum install sbt

10. Edit AWS security groups to allow port 80 (in AWS console).

11. Edit application.conf file in minions (locally on instance).
  * Change "interface" to your instance's *private* IP
  * Change port to 80

12. Build + run server (locally on instance). Do this in a tmux session so it stays up.
  * $ cd minions
  * $ sudo sbt (need sudo to connect to port 80)
  * $ buildEverything (in sbt console)
  * $ minionsJVM/run (in sbt console)

13. It's running. Open a web browser at your instance's public IP. Anyone can use this.
